## Craziest way of making NFT!

This project is starting by some of lazinest on NFT Drawing. So I made this for someone who too lazy to make many of them by merging composition into one as random using only 'canva' and 'fs' on 'nodejs'.


## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/No-Sleep-Club/bulk-nft.git
cd bulk-nft
npm i 
mkdir out
npm start
```
